**Check download-gitignore: [github.com/vccolombo/download-gitignore](https://github.com/vccolombo/download-gitignore)**

download-gitignore (dgi) was created as an alternative to searching for .gitignore files on the internet. With a simple command in the terminal, you can download a .gitignore file that best suits your project.

This CLI application is made with Python 3 and involves concepts like fetching data from the internet (in this case, Github's [.gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore)) and writing to files.

Check the [project's page](https://github.com/vccolombo/download-gitignore) on Github to learn more about it.
