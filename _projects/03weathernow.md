WeatherNow is a website to get information about the current weather in a given location. Search any location in the world and see how is the climate there right now.

This project was made as part of the [The Complete Node.js Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/). It was not focused on the frontend or in being a full-featured weather website. It was a learning project focused on fetching data from a public API and presenting it using Nodejs.
