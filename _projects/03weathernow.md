**Check WeatherNow: [WeatherNow site](https://vccolombo-weather-site.herokuapp.com/) [WeatherNow repository](https://github.com/vccolombo/WeatherNow)**

WeatherNow is a website to get information about the current weather in a given location. Search any location in the world and see how is the climate there right now.

This project was made as part of [The Complete Node.js Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/). It was a learning project focused on fetching data from a public API and presenting it using Nodejs. Even though the objective was not to learn HTML or CSS, this project challenged me to set-up a usable frontend interface, a skill that I had almost no knowledge at the time of the project.
