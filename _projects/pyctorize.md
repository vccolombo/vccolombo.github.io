Pyctorize was an idea that I had during an experimental physics class at university. The teacher asked us to record a video of the experiment and include a picture of every 10 seconds in the class report. The video was quite long (like 5 minutes or so), so I decided to automate the task by creating this app.

With Pyctorize you can get frames of videos in specific intervals, and output them all for later use.

This CLI program is made with Python and is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pyctorize/)
